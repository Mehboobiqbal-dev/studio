# **App Name**: Bias Buster Arena

## Core Features:

- Echo Chamber Simulator: Generate an 'echo feed' of absurd agreements to a user's submitted opinion, then 'bust' it with counterarguments from diverse AI personas. Creates a shareable 'meme report' with a 'Bubble Score'. This will include an AI tool to determine fact-checking for diverse AI personas.
- Multiplayer Arenas: Enable real-time debates with AI moderation, fallacy detection (using NLP as an AI tool), scoring, chat, emoji reactions, and timed rounds. Offer 1v1, group, and AI vs. Human modes with 'infection links' tailoring the arena to the recipient's inferred biases.
- Global Tournaments: Create weekly tournaments on trending topics (auto-pulled from X API or news feeds) with a bracket system.  The system includes AI-generated opponents and prizes that can be won. Community voting determines influence over the results.
- Opinion Time Capsules: Seal user opinions in vaults on the MongoDB database with future unlock dates. AI generates predictive simulations (used as a tool) about the opinion's future relevance, auto-notifying users upon unlock with shareable 'hindsight reports'.
- Personal Dashboard & Analytics: Display bias evolution using skill trees, weekly reports, and visualizations of view shifts (charts via libraries like Recharts) in a personal dashboard, which uses MongoDB to keep user data safe and persistent.
- AI-assisted Moderation: Toxic content flagged is then passed to a human for review and to prevent any abuse to the system. The system makes use of the MongoDB to help determine bad-actors based on user feedback and toxic flags.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A vibrant, bold blue (#29ABE2) to convey trust, intelligence, and open communication. It's eye-catching without being overwhelming.
- Background color: A light, desaturated blue (#E5F6FD), in order to provide a clean, neutral backdrop that keeps the focus on content.
- Accent color: A lively green (#90EE90), is selected as a vibrant contrast to the analogous blues; it is to signal actionable items such as button CTAs, to guide and engage users.
- Headline font: 'Poppins', a geometric sans-serif, should be used for a precise, contemporary, and fashionable feel.
- Body font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif, should be used in order to convey modernity and neutrality for easy readability.
- Simple, clear icons representing different debate topics and features.
- Subtle animations for loading states, transitions, and user interactions to enhance engagement.
